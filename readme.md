## Packaging into EXE

To package this script into an executable file, you can use `pyinstaller`. Here are the steps:

1. First, ensure you have `pyinstaller` installed. If not, you can install it by running:

   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. Open a command line or terminal in the project directory.

3. Run the following command to package the script:

   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --add-data "clipboard_data.json;." --add-data "sad.ico;." ClipboardManager.py
